Correlating wikipedia traffic to news events

In this project we have provided some insight in the relationship between views of Wikipedia
articles and information published on newspapers and media. We have obtained two independent
datasets with the articles, selected the most relevant documents, and modelled them into a set of
quantitative vectors using natural language processing. We have compared different NLP approaches
and used a topic coherence to come up with the model that best describes the data. We have also used
transformed the data to compare the articles and see how media news and Wikipedia searches are not
correlated on average, but there are some cases in which they are.

The picture we can extract from this analysis is that the Wikipedia searches evidence what people
are interested in, irrespective of where that interest is coming from. In some cases, like politics or
technical concepts, the interest may come from a breaking news article that gets developed afterwards.
In other, like events regarding entertainment, they may come other source like social media. This
information can be used to measure the impact of news articles in the peopleâ€™s interests.
