    "Motivate correlating data from different sources to be able to predict when to allocate extra resources to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This in reality can be extrapolated to almost anything; in fact, I can do it for how the stock market reacts to certain events...\n",

    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia project provides open access to all its data, including traffic information. There is hourly traffic data, daily aggregates, and the most viewed pages per day. Here, we want to locate skipes large enough to be considered 'unusual' or 'extraordinary', so that we isolate an article and look for events nearby.\n",

    "The hourly data is not immediately available through the API, so we'll go ahead with the daily aggregates. We could go to \n",
